# ðŸŽ¬ MovieMosaic - AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ About

MovieMosaic is an advanced movie recommendation system designed to enhance user experience through content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering techniques. Built using Streamlit, this system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP), Matrix Factorization, and Deep Neural Networks to generate highly personalized recommendations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Content-Based Filtering: Uses NLP (Word2Vec) for semantic movie similarity.
- Collaborative Filtering: User-based, item-based, and matrix factorization techniques (SVD).
- Deep Learning Model: Softmax Deep Neural Network for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
- Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches for better results.
- Performance Evaluation: RMSE scores highlight model efficiency (Deep Learning RMSE = 0.6959, Matrix Factorization RMSE = 0.8280).
